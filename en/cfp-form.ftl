    At RustFest we want to make it possible for everyone to present their ideas and showcase their work to the best of their ability, ensuring that these ideas reach a wide audience.
    For this reason we are always happy to host talks in a wide variety of languages, provided that we are able to sufficiently support them (i.e. in the form of subtitling).
    
    Feel free to propose multiple languages here (noting the order of your preference), and if accepted we will reach out to discuss the details.
