apac-announcement-2021: "The Asia-Pacific region hosts billions of people, thousands\
  \ of cultures, and even a few Rustaceans. A few of us have decided to bring you\
  \ an edition of [**RustFest Global**](https://rustfest.global/) in December!\n\n\
  [RustFest Global](https://rustfest.world/say-hello-rustfest-global-2021) is an online\

  \ of their time zone.\n\nThe APAC edition aims to be a celebration of activity,\
  \ a learning experience and a chance for the Rust communities in Asia and the Pacific\
